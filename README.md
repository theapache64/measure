> a shell function to measure the graphics performance of two APK files with maestro and gfxinfo

## ‚ú® Overview

This is a shell function called `measure` that compares the graphics performance of two Android apps (APKs) by running a flow of user interactions on each app and collecting data on the app's graphics performance using the `dumpsys gfxinfo` command. The function prompts the user to input the names of the two APKs, the flow to run on each app, an optional setup flow, and an optional number of iterations to run the flow (default is 3). The function then installs and runs the flow on each APK, collects the graphics performance data, averages the data, and saves it to a file.

## ü¶ø Prerequisites

- Android device connected to the computer via ADB
- [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) and [maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro#upgrading-the-cli) command line tools must be installed and available in the PATH
- [gfx-avg](https://github.com/theapache64/gfx-avg) command line tool must be installed and available in the PATH

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage

```console
measure <apk1> <apk2> <measureFlow> [setupFlow] [iteration]
```

- `apk1`: The file path of the first APK to test
- `apk2`: The file path of the second APK to test
- `measureFlow`: The file path of the flow file to run on each app
- `setupFlow` (optional): The file path of the setup flow file to run on each app before running the measure flow
- `iteration` (optional): The number of times to run the measure flow on each app (default is 3)

## üåä Script Flow
1. The function starts by initializing and printing some information about the input arguments.
1. The script then prompts the user to uninstall the package of the application if it is already installed.
1.  Then the script installs `apk1` and runs the setup flow if provided, otherwise it waits for the user to press enter.
1.  Then it runs the measure flow on `apk1` for the number of iterations specified, collecting the graphics performance data using the `dumpsys gfxinfo` command and saving the data to a file.
1.  Then it uninstalls `apk1`, installs `apk2` and runs the setup flow if provided, otherwise it waits for the user to press enter.
1.  Then it runs the measure flow on `apk2` for the number of `iterations` specified, collecting the graphics performance data using the `dumpsys gfxinfo` command and saving the data to a file.
1.  The script then averages the data collected from both `apk1` and `apk2` using the `gfx-avg` command.
1.  The script then prints `"Done!"`.

## üíª  Installation
- The function does not require any installation, it can be used by just copying the function to the shell script or by sourcing the script containing the function.
